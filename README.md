Scripts and documentation to build an image file for a Raspberry Pi Receive only iGate

This Github entry is not finalised... stuff is still all over the place.

The main image is available from the Waverley Members Web Site (I think!) It is definitely located in the club Google Drive.

## Overview
*   Using most Raspberry Pi's with a soundcard and a simple FM radio (e.g. Baofeng UV-5R). You can create a APRS Receiver connected to the APRS-IS system.

*   Note for these projects I use and recommend a SoundBlaster Play USB (original) I haven't tried the Soundblaster Play 2 yet but I expect it to work.
*   I have also had success with some early Logitech Headset USB adapters.
*   I have had nothing but trouble with $1,2,5,6 ebay adapters. They work perfectly on PC's but not so much on Linux and particularly ARM based units like RasPi.

*   My common setup with this is a Raspi B+ with  the soundcard a UV-5R and 2.5 - 3.5 short stereo cable from Ebay. To power it I use an Ebay 12+V to 5V USB adapter module and the battery eliminator module for the 5R.
