## Overview
*   Using most Raspberry Pi's with a soundcard and a simple FM radio (e.g. Baofeng UV-5R). You can create an APRS Receiver connected to the APRS-IS system.

*   Note for these projects I use and recommend a SoundBlaster Play USB (original) I haven't tried the Soundblaster Play 2 yet but I expect it to work.
*   I have also had success with some early Logitech Headset USB adapters.
*   I have had nothing but trouble with $1,2,5,6 ebay adapters. They work perfectly on PC's but not so much on Linux and particularly ARM based units like RasPi.
*   UPDATE: several units of cheap USB dongles marked as linux capable are now working.   

*   My common setup with this is a Raspi B+ with  the soundcard a UV-5R and 2.5 - 3.5 short stereo cable from Ebay. To power it I use an Ebay 12+V to 5V USB adapter module and the battery eliminator module for the 5R.

    
## Additional Features


## Installation

Need to put more here at the moment the main action is to create an SD card with the image and boot.

## Documentation

Sample setup documents are available in the docs folder linked here: https://github.com/sgtsmall/VK2BV_aprx_igate/tree/master/docs 

Pi aprx APRS Setup Oct15 is available in word format and pdf. This has most of what you need to set things up.

VK2BV_aprx_config.md is a copy of the setup documents in Markdown format it needs some work, refer to the pdf or word document for now.
